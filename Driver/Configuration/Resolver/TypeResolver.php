     * 2. When data from a request is submitted using {@link Form::submit()} to transform the new input data
     *    back into the renderable format. For example if you have a date field and submit '2009-10-10'
     *    you might accept this value because its easily parsed, but the transformer still writes back
     *    "2009/10/10" onto the form field (for further displaying or other purposes).
     *
     * This method must be able to deal with empty values. Usually this will
     * be NULL, but depending on your implementation other empty values are
     * possible as well (such as empty strings). The reasoning behind this is
     * that value transformers must be chainable. If the transform() method
     * of the first value transformer outputs NULL, the second value transformer
     * must be able to process that value.
     *
     * By convention, transform() should return an empty string if NULL is
     * passed.
